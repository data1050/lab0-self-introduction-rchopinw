Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 

Hi everyone, my name is Bangxi Xiao, a first-year DSI student. It's really nice to meet everyone at Brown, such a warm place!
I'm coming from Shenzhen, a small city in the south of China. Weather there is really mild and comfortable; also it's near the sea, many things to enjoy there,.
For my favourite food, I will pick fried chicken!
Well, I love computer games, especially League of Legends, hope that guys can play with me!
I am currently in Cambodia waiting for my visa issued, hope to see you guys soon~
